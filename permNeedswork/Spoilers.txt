Here is a list of bugs in this app!  Note that this list may or may not entirely complete...

SPOILER ALERT: Don't read this until you've tried to find and fix the bugs yourself!

HTML
* links to CSS and JS files have incorrect path.
* jQuery link is omitted.  (Make sure you include this file before the other JS file!)

CSS
* missing semicolon

PHP
* "$TWITTER_API_URL/$params" needs a "?", not a "/"
* imploding the $_GET arguments is misguided - you need a loop that pulls the keys and values in the array and sticks an "=" between each, before the imploding occurs

JAVASCRIPT
* misspelled "function"
* the Tweetlicious function needs to be executed in order to return its public methods.  Surround the whole thing in parentheses and follow it with ();
* setInterval arguments are in the wrong order
* if you're reading in JSON, use $.getJSON(), not $.get()
* input[name='username'] -- transpose ' and ]
* onsubmit handler must end with return false;
* $("tweetArea ul") -- tweetArea should be .tweetArea
* $("input[name='username]'").html() should actually be val() -- the contents of an <input> are stored in its "value" attribute
* $(divs[0]).html = data[0].text won't work -- you need to pass data[0].text as an argument to html().  The same bug exists elsewhere in the code
* The placeNewTweet() function's approach is entirely misguided! Fix it!
