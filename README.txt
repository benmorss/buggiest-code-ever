This application is supposed to pull tweets from a Twitter user, using the Twitter API, and place them on the screen!  As new tweets come in, they should appear as old tweets scroll off the page.  Unfortunately, it is riddled with bugs.  Can you find the bugs?

This is designed to give you practice with various debugging techniques, mostly in Javascript, but also to a certain extent in HTML and PHP.  And a little CSS for good measure.

The code in the "good" directory works... mostly... and the code in the "needswork" directory needs, well, work.  The Spoilers.txt file provides hints for fixing it.

Good luck!
